This project consists of a parser which reads the plan text file in a pre-defined format and converts it to an xml file

It also does validations for invalid data format, missing data (for refereed node).

How to run the project
----------------------

1) To run the file, set the classpath to include the libraries in the lib folder along with project class files.
2) Run the GedcomParser.java,
    a) it will ask for the location of the text file. You can point it to the file included in the project or any other file
       in same format
    b) next it will ask for the output file location & name, if file does not exists it will generate the parser response
       in the supplied xml name.

Test Case
----------

I have written a test case to back the code along with the parser. It tests for various conditions such as 
1) Error reading/opening files
2) Wrong format of the file (other than given in problem statement)
3) Missing node reference (case where a node refer to a node which does not exists)
